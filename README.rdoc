= One True Repo

== One feed to rule them all, and in the mashup bind them.

Created by {Stephen McDonald}[http://twitter.com/stephen_mcd]

_One_ _True_ _Repo_ merges both the {GitHub}[http://github.com] and
{Bitbucket}[http://bitbucket.org] APIs into a single JSON feed,
for the purpose of combining numbers of watchers and forks across
duplicate repositories. It comes as both a {Sinatra}[http://sinatrarb.com]
app and command-line gem.

=== Sinatra

The Sinatra app is hosted on Heroku at {otr.jupo.org}[http://otr.jupo.org].
Add your username to the path to get your feed. For example my GitHub and
Bitbucket username is +stephenmcd+ so my feed is available at
{otr.jupo.org/stephenmcd}[http://otr.jupo.org/stephenmcd]. If you have
different usernames between GitHub and Bitbucket, you can use the URL
{otr.jupo.org/github_username/bitbucket_username}[http://otr.jupo.org/github_username/bitbucket_username]
to provide them separately. Note that feeds are cached for about 24
hours.

=== JSON

Here's a sample of the JSON provided:

  [
      {
          "name": "mezzanine",
          "urls": [
              "https://github.com/stephenmcd/mezzanine",
              "https://bitbucket.org/stephenmcd/mezzanine"
          ],
          "watchers": 316,
          "forks": 102,
          "fork": false
      },
      {
          "name": "django-socketio",
          "urls": [
              "https://github.com/stephenmcd/django-socketio",
              "https://bitbucket.org/stephenmcd/django-socketio"
          ],
          "watchers": 112,
          "forks": 11,
          "fork": false
      }
  ]

=== JSONP

You can also append a +callback+ parameter to the Sinatra app's URLs,
specifying the name of a JavaScript function to call:

  <script>
      var displayRepos = function(repos) {
          // The repos argument will contain the
          // JSON data for stephenmcd's feed.
          var watchers = 0, forks = 0;
          for (var i = 0; i < repos.length; i++) {
              watchers += repos[i].watchers;
              forks += repos[i].forks;
          }
          alert('Total watchers: ' + watchers + '\nTotal forks: ' + forks);
      }
  </script>
  <script src="http://otr.jupo.org/stephenmcd?callback=displayRepos"></script>

=== Ruby Gem

_One_ _True_ _Repo_ is also an installable gem named +otr+. Install the
+otr+ gem with the following command:

  $ gem install otr

Once installed, +otr+ can be called from the command-line and will output
its JSON feed:

  Usage: otr [options]

      -u, --username NAME              Combined GitHub / Bitbucket username
      -g, --github-username NAME       GitHub username if different from
                                       Bitbucket username (required without -u)
      -b, --bitbucket-username NAME    Bitbucket username if different from
                                       GitHub username (required without -u)
      -h, --help                       Show this message
      -v, --version                    Show version

You can also use +otr+ in your own Ruby code:

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'otr'

  # With a combined username:
  options = {:username => "stephenmcd"}

  # Or with differing usernames:
  options = {:github_username => "alice", :bitbucket_username => "bob"}

  json = OTR.get(options).to_json
